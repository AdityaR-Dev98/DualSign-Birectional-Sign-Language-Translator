DualSign
DualSign is an innovative real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition and prediction system, designed to assist users in bridging communication gaps between sign language users and others. The project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to preprocess video input, enabling dynamic detection and display of ASL signs. DualSign includes features like simulated sentence predictions, user-friendly visual interfaces, and a delay-managed prediction system, all optimized for seamless interaction.
